;;; Single-shot HTTP client. One request in, one response out, bounded by a
;;; caller deadline. Redirects are not followed and statuses pass through
;;; untouched: callers decide what a 3xx or a 404 means for them. A text body
;;; comes back as a string and any other as base64, named by :BODY-ENCODING.
;;;
;;; The exchange runs under CALL-WITH-DEADLINE, which owns the connection so
;;; the deadline or a cancel can close it.
;;;
;;; Trust posture: arbitrary network egress. Trusted operator only.
