;;; Self-modification (~takeiteasy/nyaa#12): evaluate in the host image,
;;; redefine functions and classes, and reload a mounted child -- the three
;;; things tool-eval, tool-repl and a worker can never reach, since a worker
;;; loads nothing and shares no state with the running harness.
;;;
;;; Every write op (:eval, :define, :reload) is off by default. :ENABLE, a
;;; mount option, names the ops a caller may reach; :LOG alone is always
;;; answered, since it only reads back what a write already did. This
;;; records operator intent and gives an audit trail -- it is not a sandbox.
;;; A :form can still redefine TOOL-TRUST or RESOLVE-TOOLS, since it runs in
;;; the host image with no DSL between it and CL:EVAL; the plan gate (#6)
;;; constrains a *model's* reach, not an operator's.
;;;
;;; A write takes a checkpoint first (checkpoint.lisp) and logs an intent
;;; entry naming it before the op runs, then an outcome entry after -- so a
;;; crash mid-eval still leaves a trace pointing at the generation to roll
;;; back to. The log is a second, append-only s-expression file alongside
;;; the generation directory, read the same guarded way (checkpoint.lisp's
;;; %READ-GENERATION): *READ-EVAL* nil, so a submitted form can never run
;;; merely by the log being read back. Each entry also reaches meow's
;;; logger, when one is mounted, for live visibility; the file is the
;;; durable copy.

;;;
;;; SBCL's own PCL/DEFSTRUCT loaders are hooked to say exactly when a form's
;;; evaluation is inside a class, method, generic-function or struct
;;; mutation, so :DEFINE only defers a lapsed deadline for the duration of
;;; one mutation instead of across the whole form.
;;;
;;; *CLOS-MUTATION-LATCH*, bound fresh by RUN-IN-HOST for each evaluation,
;;; counts the mutations in flight. Outside one the interrupt lands
;;; pre-emptively, so a wedged :eql specializer or slow compile is killed,
;;; not leaked; inside one it only records itself as pending, and the
;;; mutation's own exit throws once the count returns to zero. A form killed
;;; after landing a mutation is partially applied and reports :ABANDONED.
;;;
;;; A mutation gets *CLOS-MUTATION-GRACE-MS* to finish. If user code inside
;;; it (a MOP method, a defstruct constructor macro) outlasts that, the
;;; interrupt throws out of it anyway and the form reports :TORN: that one
;;; definition may be half applied.
;;;
;;; The hooks are installed with SB-INT:ENCAPSULATE, the primitive TRACE and
;;; PROFILE use, so a rename breaks loudly. They are gated on the latch
;;; being bound, so a DEFMETHOD elsewhere in the image is unaffected.
;;;
