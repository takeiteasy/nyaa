;;; The agent loop. A meow agent (M:AGENT) that sends a conversation to a
;;; bound model, dispatches the tool calls that come back, feeds the results
;;; in and goes round again. Driven by messages rather than a blocking call,
;;; so it stays responsive between turns -- CANCEL and STEER land during a
;;; run, not just before one -- and a sub-agent delegated under meow's own
;;; agent supervisor reports back into the same machine. See docs/agent.md.
;;;
;;; Every outbound piece of work -- a model turn, a tool call, a sub-agent --
;;; is issued off the agent's process and reported back as a message, so
;;; HANDLE is never blocked waiting on one. A turn and a tool call are sent
;;; with M:CALL-ASYNC and answer as a (:REPLY tag value status) message,
;;; holding no thread meanwhile; a sub-agent is a delegated agent of its own.
;;;
;;; Finishing a run returns (values :done result) from HANDLE for a delegated
;;; agent, which is M:AGENT's own convention: the parent gets :agent-done and
;;; the agent exits, so the run is its whole life. A mounted agent has no parent
;;; and stays up, holding its conversation for the next :run.
