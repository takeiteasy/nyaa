;;; A subprocess launched in its own process group, so a deadline can signal
;;; everything it spawned rather than the direct child alone. Shared by
;;; `run-command` (tools/shell.lisp) and the worker launch/kill pair
;;; (worker.lisp) -- one helper instead of two copies of the same trick.
;;;
;;; Four strategies, tried in order and settled once at load time:
;;;
;;;   :native -- some hosts already put a launched child in its own process
;;;              group (its pgid comes back equal to its pid) with no help
;;;              needed. Nothing to prefix; TERMINATE-PROCESS-GROUP just
;;;              signals -pid.
;;;   :perl   -- macOS has no `setsid`, so a
;;;              `perl -e 'setpgrp; exec @ARGV'` wrapper sets the group on
;;;              the spawn path instead, ahead of the real command.
;;;   :setsid -- Linux's `setsid` does the same job without needing perl.
;;;              It refuses to fork a new session when the caller is
;;;              already a group leader, which is not this launch path, so
;;;              the wrapped pid stays the group id.
;;;   :tree   -- no grouping mechanism at all.
;;;
;;; TERMINATE-PROCESS-GROUP does not trust a grouping mechanism to have
;;; reached every descendant on its own: it always ALSO walks `ps`'s ppid
;;; column and kills the descendant tree by hand, on every strategy, not
;;; just :TREE. That walk is not atomic -- a child forked between it and
;;; the kill can still escape -- so the group kill above it still matters
;;; where one is available; the tree walk is insurance underneath it.
