;;; A subprocess launched in its own process group, so a deadline can signal
;;; everything it spawned rather than the direct child alone. Shared by
;;; `run-command` (tools/shell.lisp) and the worker launch/kill pair
;;; (worker.lisp) -- one helper instead of two copies of the same trick.
;;;
;;; Four strategies, tried in order and settled once at load time:
;;;
;;;   :native -- some hosts already put a launched child in its own process
;;;              group (its pgid comes back equal to its pid) with no help
;;;              needed. Nothing to prefix; TERMINATE-PROCESS-GROUP just
;;;              signals -pid.
;;;   :perl   -- macOS has no `setsid`, so a
;;;              `perl -e 'setpgrp; exec @ARGV'` wrapper sets the group on
;;;              the spawn path instead, ahead of the real command.
;;;   :setsid -- Linux's `setsid` does the same job without needing perl.
;;;              It refuses to fork a new session when the caller is
;;;              already a group leader, which is not this launch path, so
;;;              the wrapped pid stays the group id.
;;;   :tree   -- no grouping mechanism at all: the whole descendant tree is
;;;              found by walking `ps`'s ppid column and killed alongside
;;;              the leader. Not atomic -- a child forked between the walk
;;;              and the kill can still escape -- so it is the last resort.
;;;
;;; Without any of the first three, launch and kill fall back to :TREE.
;;; Before this ticket, that fallback was a leader-only kill instead, which
;;; a backgrounded grandchild could still outlive. Closes ~takeiteasy/nyaa#54.
