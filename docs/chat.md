# Chat

`nyaa chat` is a line-by-line chat with one [agent](agent.md). It streams the
answer, shows tool calls and their results, and takes a line typed mid-run as
a steer, and [saves each run](#saving-and-resuming) so a chat can be resumed.
It is the secondary system `nyaa/cli`, drawn from
[client state](client-state.md).

```sh
nyaa chat --model ollama:llama3.2 --tools tool-fs
```

```
> how many .lisp files are here?
[fs-list (:PATH ".")]
[result (:OK (:ENTRIES ...))]
There are 41.
> and in tests/?
```

## Options

The options of [`nyaa run`](cli.md#options), without `PROMPT` and `-v`, and
`--resume`. A prompt argument is a usage error (exit 2).

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--resume [ID]` | carry on a [saved chat](#saving-and-resuming): the newest, or the one named `ID`; not with `--model`, `--tools`, `--system-file`, `--system-replace` or `--max-turns` |

## Keys

| Input | While idle | While a run is under way |
|---|---|---|
| a line | starts a run that carries on from the conversation | [steers](ui.md#commands) the run |
| an empty line | ignored | ignored |
| Ctrl-C | leaves the chat | cancels the run, and the chat carries on |
| Ctrl-D | leaves the chat | leaves the chat |

The agent is mounted as `:chat` and holds the conversation, so each line sees
what came before. It is unmounted when the chat ends.

## Output

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| text | the answer, as it streams |
| `[name args]` | a tool call, arguments shortened to 200 characters |
| `[result ...]` | what it answered, shortened the same way |
| `[turn-retry ...]`, `[context-trimmed ...]` and the like | notices from the run |
| `[run ended: reason]` | the run stopped for any reason but `:stop` |
| `> ` | the run is over; the next line goes to the model |

An existing install needs `nyaa install` again to get `chat` and `chats` into its saved core.

## Saving and resuming

Each run that ends is saved as a [generation](checkpoints.md), one folder per
chat under `$NYAA_HOME/chats/`[^save]. A chat that runs nothing saves nothing.

```sh
nyaa chats
# 20260925-191231-123456-482  2026-09-25T18:12:40Z  how many .lisp files are here?
nyaa chat --resume                        # the newest chat
nyaa chat --resume 20260925-191231-123456-482
```

`nyaa chats` prints one line per chat, newest first: its id, when it was last
saved and its first line. `--resume` prints the saved conversation as it was
drawn, then a prompt; the next line carries on from it. The model, tools and
system prompt are the saved ones, and a resumed chat keeps saving into its own
folder.

| Exit | When |
|---|---|
| 2 | nothing saved, no chat with that id, or `--resume` with an option that describes a new agent |
| 1 | the saved agent, provider or a tool could not be mounted again, e.g. its class is gone |

A provider's API key is never saved: it comes from the same environment
variable as in a new chat ([credentials](checkpoints.md#credentials)).

## Limitations

- A line that reads as Lisp is sent as a prompt
  ([#204](https://todo.sr.ht/~takeiteasy/nyaa/204)).
- The chat draws the [text the provider streams](protocols.md#streaming), so an
  answer that is not streamed is not shown
  ([#205](https://todo.sr.ht/~takeiteasy/nyaa/205)).
- The options of a resumed chat cannot be changed
  ([#207](https://todo.sr.ht/~takeiteasy/nyaa/207)).
- Saved chats are never deleted or pruned
  ([#208](https://todo.sr.ht/~takeiteasy/nyaa/208)).

[^save]: Saved by a thread of its own, so a slow disk never holds up the
    prompt, and once more as the chat ends, so a run cut short by Ctrl-D is kept.
    Only the newest generation of a chat is kept.
